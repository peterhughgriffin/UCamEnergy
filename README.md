# University of Cambridge Energy Monitor

This project aims to create tools that can be used by members of the University across departments to easily explore and gain insight from the energy data provided to them by the University's Energy And Environment team. The project was started by the Materials Science and Metallurgy Green Impact team, but we hope that as well as allowing us to better understand our energy use, these tools will enable everyone to easily answer the questions they're most interested in regarding their energy use.

Once we've built more we'll describe how it all works here!
